# RSQ_implementation
This repository is an implementation of Risk-sensitive Q-Learning algorithm from the work of Fei et al. "Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement Learning: Near-Optimal Risk-Sample Tradeoff in Regret". Slightly modified version of this algorithm is used for solving risk-sensitive variation of portfolio optimization problem.
